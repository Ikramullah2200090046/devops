Cloud computing is categorized into several types based on the deployment models and service models. Here are the primary types of cloud computing:

### Deployment Models:

1. **Public Cloud:**
   - **Description:** Public cloud services are provided by third-party vendors and are made available to the general public. Resources are shared among multiple users.
   - **Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. **Private Cloud:**
   - **Description:** Private clouds are dedicated to a single organization. They can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
   - **Examples:** VMware, OpenStack, Microsoft Azure Stack.

3. **Hybrid Cloud:**
   - **Description:** Hybrid clouds combine elements of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
   - **Examples:** Organizations might use a public cloud for scalable computing resources and a private cloud for sensitive data.

4. **Community Cloud:**
   - **Description:** Community clouds are shared by multiple organizations with similar concerns (e.g., regulatory requirements, security needs).
   - **Examples:** A cloud infrastructure shared by a group of healthcare organizations.

### Service Models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
   - **Description:** IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking.
   - **Examples:** Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
   - **Description:** PaaS offers a platform that includes infrastructure, middleware, and development tools, allowing users to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
   - **Examples:** Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.

3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
   - **Description:** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install, manage, and maintain the software.
   - **Examples:** Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365.

Each combination of deployment and service models serves different business needs and use cases. Organizations often choose a specific cloud type based on factors such as scalability requirements, security considerations, compliance needs, and the level of control they want over their infrastructure and applications. The flexibility offered by these different types of cloud services allows businesses to tailor their cloud solutions to match their specific requirements.
