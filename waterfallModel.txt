The waterfall model follows sequential application design process for software development. It comes with good control but lacks revisions. It is a goal based development but without any scope of revision. The waterfall model has long been used for software development:


It has its advantages, as follows:
Easy to understand
Easy to manage—the input and output of each phase is defined Sequential process—order is maintained
Better control

However, it is only useful in scenarios where requirements are predefined and fixed. As it is a rigid model with a sequential process, we can't go back to any phase and change things. It has its share of disadvantages, as follows:
No revision
No outcome or application package until all phases are completed Not possible to integrate feedback until all phases are completed Not suitable for changing requirements
Not suitable for long-term and complex projects
